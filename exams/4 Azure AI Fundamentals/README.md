üìù Example Output:

```
now                ‚Üí DateTime  
students           ‚Üí PersonType  
teachers           ‚Üí PersonType  
distance learning  ‚Üí Skill  
Today              ‚Üí DateTime-Date  
classrooms         ‚Üí Location  
classmates         ‚Üí PersonType  
education          ‚Üí Skill  
Microsoft          ‚Üí Organization  
175                ‚Üí Quantity-Number  
183,000            ‚Üí Quantity-Number  
```

### ‚ùì**Which type of natural language processing was performed?**

</br>

### ‚úÖ Options:

**A.** Translation
**B.** Sentiment analysis
**C.** Key phrase extraction
**D.** Entity recognition ‚úÖ ‚Üê *Correct Answer*

</br>

* People (`students`, `teachers`)
* Organizations (`Microsoft`)
* Dates and quantities (`Today`, `175`, `183,000`)
* Skills (`education`, `remote learning`)

This is a classic example of **Entity Recognition**, where the system classifies elements in text into predefined categories.
